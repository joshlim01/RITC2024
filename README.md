## Rotman International Trading Competition (RITC)

The Rotman International Trading Competition (RITC) is an annual event hosted by the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, bringing together top students from around the world to compete in simulated trading cases. The competition spans three days, testing participants' skills in areas like market making, algorithmic trading, and portfolio management. Each case is designed to simulate real-world market scenarios, including commodities trading, volatility trading, and algorithmic forecasting. Teams must employ quantitative analysis, strategy, and teamwork to optimize their performance across various financial instruments and market conditions.

This trading competition consists six primary cases in the trading competition. Each case tests participants on different aspects of trading strategies, market analysis, and algorithm development:

- **Commodities Case**  
  Participants engage in a closed market for crude oil, focusing on production, refinement, and storage while complying with carbon credits. Emphasis is on teamwork, understanding supply-demand dynamics, and role-specific trading.

- **ETF Case**  
  Teams assess liquidity risk across tender offers, profiting from price differentials, and efficiently closing out large positions. This case emphasizes critical thinking and quick decision-making.

- **Algorithmic CAPM Forecasting Case**  
  Participants develop trading algorithms using CAPM to predict asset prices. They capture historical prices, calculate beta, and execute trades based on market trends for high-frequency profits.

- **Electricity Trading Case**  
  Teams operate in a regulated electricity market, forecasting supply and demand, managing power generation and distribution, and optimizing trades based on real-time conditions.

- **MathWorks Volatility Trading Case**  
  This options trading case focuses on volatility. Participants trade an ETF tracking a stock index with a variety of options, identifying mispricing opportunities to maximize returns.

- **Algorithmic Market Making Case**  
  Participants build market-making algorithms to profit from bid-ask spreads. The algorithms adapt to market changes and are rewarded through a feebate structure that promotes high-frequency trading.
